# Reverse_Polish_Notation
Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation
or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which 
operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation
(PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need 
any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number 
of operands.
